### Description

Bike Guardian stands as the ultimate solution for parents and guardians seeking to enhance the safety of their children during cycling adventures. Through its user-friendly interactive map, families can effortlessly locate destinations and plan secure routes, taking into consideration factors such as real-time traffic conditions, available bicycle lanes, and the lowest elevation.

With the ability to track their current location, families can confidently partake in biking activities together, choosing the safest roads with Bike Guardian.

Bid farewell to repetitive tutorials â€“ our modal's tutorial for map usage automatically saves your progress to localStorage, guaranteeing that you never have to go through it again.

### APIs

Bike Guardian harnesses the capabilities of four primary APIs: TomTom Routing, TomTom Reverse Geocoding, OpenWeatherMap, and AQI (Air Quality Index), ensuring users receive high-quality information and optimized routes. In conjunction with these APIs, Bike Guardian integrates the Leaflet.js library, along with the Jawg Maps Tile API and MapQuest Tile API, to offer an engaging and visually appealing mapping experience. These technological components collectively contribute to enhancing cycling safety and convenience.

### Design

The app's design aimed for a child-friendly appeal while maintaining attractiveness for adults and parents. A sky blue color was chosen as the primary hue, striking a balance between friendliness and professionalism. It's easy on the eyes and appeals to children without being overly corporate. Vector images depict a family cycling together, reinforcing the app's focus. The logo underwent modifications to infuse a slightly fun and quirky feel into the letters.

Upon launching the app, users encounter a landing page offering a brief description of Bike Guardian's purpose. They then transition directly to the map dashboard screen. Given the app's unique features compared to traditional navigation maps, a modal tutorial guides users through its main functionalities, ensuring a smooth introduction.

Recognizing its family-oriented nature, the app incorporates various safety features. Alongside the map, users find buttons to access information such as traffic flow, nearby incidents, and the air quality of the area. Additionally, general biking safety tips are conveniently displayed at the bottom of the screen.

The app prioritizes simplicity for users of all ages. All features are consolidated on the dashboard after the landing screen, eliminating the need for users to input starting and ending addresses. They can simply tap their way to the destination directly on the map.

Starting as a rudimentary black and white wireframe, the app evolved into a comprehensive Figma prototype. This transition allowed for the development of most functionalities and animations, ensuring a user-friendly and visually engaging experience.

### Future Development


Bike Guardian remains committed to elevating the cycling experience for families and is actively exploring innovative ideas to propel the app to new heights. Among the exciting upcoming features is the ability for users to download routes as files, providing information on the duration and distance of their chosen routes. This empowers users to easily track and plan their rides.

The integration of Strava's API introduces a new dimension, allowing users to view their performance statistics and monitor their progress directly within the Bike Guardian app. Going a step further, a proposed feature involves generating routes based on the user's past rides and performance data on Strava. This not only challenges users to enhance their cycling skills but also encourages them to explore new routes.

Introducing a leaderboard adds a playful element of competition. Users can compare their statistics with friends or other Bike Guardian users, fostering a sense of camaraderie and achievement. To enhance safety, each generated route will come with a Bike Guardian safety rating, providing users with added peace of mind as they embark on their cycling journeys. The future of Bike Guardian is set to bring an array of features that promise to make the cycling experience both enjoyable and rewarding.
